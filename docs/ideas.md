### "Glotti" - Real-time Negotiation & Speech Coach
*   **Concept:** A sparring partner for public speaking or negotiation that interrupts you with counter-arguments and feedback.
*   **How it works:**
    *   User practices a speech or negotiation tactic.
    *   Agent listens to audio and watches video (posture, eye contact).
    *   It interrupts in real-time to challenge weak points: "You're hedging too much here, be more assertive," or "That argument is circular, try the economic angle."
    *   Great for interview prep, sales training, or debate practice.
*   **Why it's a good idea:** Feedback loops are usually slow (record -> listen -> critique). This makes the feedback loop instant and interactive.

#### Variations on "Glotti":
*   **5.1 "PitchPerfect" (Startup Founder Focus):** Specifically tuned for founders pitching to investors. The agent acts as a skeptical VC. It listens to the pitch and *interrupts* with tough questions: "What's your CAC?", "How are you defending against Google?", or "You're spending too much time on the problem, get to the solution." It measures speaking pace, filler words ("um," "like"), and confidence levels.
*   **5.2 "EmpathyTrainer" (Customer Success/HR Focus):** Focused on handling difficult conversations (firing an employee, dealing with an angry customer). The agent adopts the persona of the upset individual. It uses the Gemini Live API to detect the user's tone (are they sounding defensive? dismissive?) and coaches them in real-time: "Your tone is escalating, try to validate their frustration first," or "You're speaking too fast, slow down to show you are listening."
*   **5.3 "Veritalk" (Political/Media Debate Sparring):** Tuned for adversarial debates. The user inputs a core thesis, and the agent pulls real-time counter-arguments from the web (using Google Search grounding). As the user speaks, the agent aggressively interrupts with fact-checks or opposing viewpoints. It forces the user to think on their feet and learn how to gracefully handle interruptions without losing their train of thought.
