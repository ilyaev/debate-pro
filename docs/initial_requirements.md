Application Requirements:
Please find the Application Requirements and Submission Requirements outlined below (hereinafter, referred to collectively as the “Requirements”).

What to Create:

Entrants must develop a NEW next-generation AI Agent that utilizes multimodal inputs and outputs. The project must move beyond simple text-in/text-out interactions. It should leverage Google’s Live API with the creative power of video/image generation to solve complex problems or create entirely new user experiences. All projects must leverage a Gemini model, agents must be built using Google GenAI SDK or Agent Development Kit, and projects must use at least one Google Cloud service. All use of Google developer tools, including input and outputs for this Contest must abide by the Google Cloud Acceptable Use Policy at https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup to meet the Requirements, and will be disqualified if they not not abide by the Acceptable Use Policy.

Projects must be built within one of these three categories:

Live Agents

Focus: Real-time Interaction (Audio/Vision).
Build an agent that users can talk to naturally can be interrupted. This could be a real-time translator, a vision-enabled customized tutor that "sees" your homework, or a customer support voice agent that handles interruptions gracefully.
Mandatory Tech: Must use Gemini Live API or  the use of ADK. The agents are hosted on Google Cloud.
Creative Storyteller

Focus: Multimodal Storytelling with Interleaved Output
Build an agent that thinks and creates like a creative director, seamlessly weaving together text, images, audio, and video in a single, fluid output stream. Leverage Gemini's native interleaved output to generate rich, mixed-media responses that combine narration with visuals, explanations with generated imagery, or storyboards with voiceover, all in one cohesive flow. Examples include Interactive storybooks (text + generated illustrations inline),  marketing asset generator (copy + visuals + video in one go), educational explainers (narration woven with diagrams), and social content creator (caption + image + hashtags together).
Mandatory Tech: Must use Gemini's interleaved/mixed output capabilities. The agents are hosted on Google Cloud.
UI Navigator

Focus: Visual UI Understanding & Interaction
Build an agent that becomes the user's hands on screen. The agent observes the browser or device display, interprets visual elements with or without relying on APIs or DOM access, and performs actions based on user intent. Examples include a universal web navigator, a cross-application workflow automator, or a visual QA testing agent.
Mandatory Tech: Must use Gemini multimodal to interpret screenshots/screen recordings and output executable actions. The agents are hosted on Google Cloud.
